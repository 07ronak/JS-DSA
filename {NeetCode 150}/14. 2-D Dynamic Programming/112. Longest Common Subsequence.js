/* Given two strings text1 and text2, return the length of their longest common subsequence. If there is 
no common subsequence, return 0.

A subsequence of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters 
(can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.

-For example, "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde".

A common subsequence of two strings is a subsequence that is common to both strings. 

Example 1:
    Input: text1 = "abcde", text2 = "ace" 
    Output: 3  
    Explanation: The longest common subsequence is "ace" and its length is 3.

Example 2:
    Input: text1 = "abc", text2 = "abc"
    Output: 3
    Explanation: The longest common subsequence is "abc" and its length is 3.

Example 3:
    Input: text1 = "abc", text2 = "def"
    Output: 0
    Explanation: There is no such common subsequence, so the result is 0. */
